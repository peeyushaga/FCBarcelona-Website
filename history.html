        Barça delight the world with their brand of football that is appreciated by football fans from all over the
        world. They win three more Champions League titles in a decade of dominance for the blaugranes.<br><br>
      </p>

      <p class="page-body-text">
        From the season 2008/09 under Josep Guardiola, the team improved even further. Playing with the same style that
        Cruyff had introduced, Guardiola was a firm supporter of basing his team around the club's own youth system and
        promoted several young talents to the first team, and the result was the greatest Barça team ever.<br>
        The greatest international recognition of this came when the FIFA Ballon d'Or nominations in 2010 shortlisted
        Xavi, Iniesta and Messi for the honour, all three of whom had grown up at La Masia, the residence where young
        sportspeople of all ages are trained and educated.<br>
        This team was the culmination of everything that FC Barcelona stands for, and produced an amazing string of
        major titles, including two Champions Leagues and three Spanish Leagues, plus the long-awaited Clubs World Cup
        which was finally won in 2009, that extraordinary year when Barcelona won all six major trophies, something
        unprecedented in the history of European football. Barça broke all kinds of records, played memorable matches
        and won just about every title on offer. But the finest hour for Guardiola's side came at Wembley on 28 May,
        2011, when the world was enchanted by the kind of football that dreams are made of. The world's press bestowed
        praise on this extraordinary side that had written one of the most incredible chapters in the history of the
        game. The Guardiola era ended in 2012 but Barça continued their success under Tito Vilanova (the league in
        2012/13) and Luis Enrique who in 2015 won the Champions League, the League and the Copa del Rey in another
        historic treble winning season.<br>
        But it wasn't just the football team that was collecting honours. The basketball, handball, futsal and roller
        hockey teams also won further European titles. Furthermore, the season 2011/12 and 2014/15 ended with a new
        record by winning 17 professional titles. Never before had FC Barcelona won so much silverware in a single
        season during its 118 year history.

        The centenary celebrations were a demonstration of what Barça means to people, an emotional journey through the
        Club's history that lasted the whole year
      </p>

      <p class="page-body-text">
        Few organisations reach their one hundredth anniversary, for doing so requires consistence and continuity. The
        aim of FC Barcelona's centenary was to celebrate the link between a glorious past and new hope for the future.

        The commemorative events saw an outpouring of Barça sentiment, and offered an emotional opportunity to spend a
        year looking back at the Club's proud history. Several important figures from Catalan culture were involved, as
        did the media and several major organisations. Famous artist Antoni Tàpies designed the official Centenary
        poster, thus adding his name to list of internationally renowned artists and writers that have helped aggrandise
        FC Barcelona's symbolic universe over the years.

        The 1998-99 season, that of the Centenary celebrations, was also historic because of the many sporting
        achievements: all four of the Club's professional sections (Football, Basketball, Handball and Roller Hockey)
        won their respective league titles.

        In 2003, newly elected president Joan Laporta brought with him a young and dynamic generation of directors who
        totally changed the Club's image. His priority was to make it possible for the club's sporting successes to have
        a knock-on effect on the more social aspects of the Club.

        The following years were spectacular in many ways: there was sporting success, an exponential increase in
        membership, economic progress that situated the Club among the world's elite and an unprecedented focus on
        charity projects that was culminated with Barça's collaboration agreement with Unicef in 2006, which projects
        Barça's caring image around the world, thus definitively globalising the notion of being "more than a club".

        Barça win their first European Cup in 1992
      </p>

      <p class="page-body-text">
        From 1988 on, with Cruyff as manager, Barça came to be associated once more with excellent football and sporting
        success. The board of directors presided over by Josep Lluís Nuñez focused on building up a team of footballers
        that would spark enthusiasm and perform well. The Camp Nou began to fill up once again.

        FC Barcelona managed to secure four consecutive Spanish League championships, between 1990 and 1994. Winning the
        European Cup in 1992 was the pinnacle of this period, which was characterised by the team’s one touch play and
        attacking style and the winning mentality of Cruyff’s players.

        Known as the 'Dream Team' of European football, the following unforgettable players went down in the Club’s
        history: Zubizarreta, Bakero, Begiristain, Laudrup, Koeman, Stoichkov, Romário, Eusebio, Nadal, Guardiola, Amor,
        Juan Carlos, Ferrer, Nando, Julio Salinas, Serna, Alexanko and Goikoetxea.

        Led by the Cruyff-Rexach duo, the team finally drew a line under its troubled past; Barça became one of the
        biggest names in world football.
